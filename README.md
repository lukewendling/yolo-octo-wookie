An Elevator Programming Exercise
================================

I set out to write a program to handle elevator requests - inspired by the seemingly sluggish elevators in my 4 story apartment complex.

Objectives
----------
* Responsive: each elevator in a bank should respond quickly to new requests
* Use an event-based program design
* Simple design: simpler is better
